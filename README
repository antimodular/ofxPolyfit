ofxPolyFit

Fit data between any 2 datasets of arbitrary dimensionality

Just a quick note to introduce ofxPolyfit. It’s an openFrameworks extension which allows you to correlate between any 2 numerical datasets of the same or different dimensionality. e.g. a stereo cam is 2x2D, and you want to get 3D, so you could use ofxPolyfit to create your 4D->3D correlation.

Latest news is that I’ve added a simple RANSAC implementation which lets you filter out good data from poor datasets. This is to be used with our tree projection experiments to filter out bad voxels.


Currently i'm working on making things more object oriented (e.g. classes for datasets, datapoints, coefficent sets, bases)
